            <h1 id="cryptocurrencies"><b>Cryptocurrencies</b></h1>

            <hr>

            <p>Cryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses cryptography to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies lack a central issuing or regulating authority, instead using a decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units.
            These currencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders. Additionally, units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from brokers, then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets.</p>
            
            <p>We are tasked to create an analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. Since there is no known output, we will be using unsupervised machine learning to help create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm and then use data visualizations to share our findings.</p>

            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2 id="results"><b>Data Process</b></h2>

            <hr>

            <h5><b>The Data</b></h5>

            <p>
                CryptoCompare is a global cryptocurrency market data provider, giving institutional and retail investors access to real-time, high-quality, reliable market 
                and pricing data on 5,300+ coins. This data is aggregated from numerous cryptocurrency trading platforms (CTPs) around the world. Our raw dataset includes 
                6 different variables associated with 1,252 cryptocurrencies. The data selection, processing, and transformation Python code can be viewed in 
                the <code>crypto_clustering.ipynb</code> file.
            </p>

            <p>
                Additionally, we preprocessed the data for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by keeping all cryptocurrencies that are being traded and have a working algorithm. 
                We also kept the rows where coins are being mined.
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to utilize PCA, we have to quantify the columns <code>Algorithm</code> and <code>ProofType</code> and convert them into dummy variables. For example:
            </p>

            $$
            \text{Algorithm_}(\cdots) =
            \begin{cases}
                0,  &amp; \text{True} \\
                1, &amp; \text{False}
            \end{cases}
            $$

            $$
            \text{ProofType_}(\cdots) =
            \begin{cases}
                0,  &amp; \text{True} \\
                1, &amp; \text{False}
            \end{cases}
            $$

            <p>
                For this analysis, we will be using Principal Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering to understand how the <code>Algorithm</code>, 
                <code>ProofType</code>, <code>TotalCoinsMined</code>, and <code>TotalCoinSupply</code> differ between cryptocurrencies.
            </p>

            <h5 id="principal-component-analysis-pca-"><b>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</b></h5>

            <p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most used unsupervised machine learning algorithms across a variety of applications: exploratory data analysis, dimensionality reduction, information compression, and data de-noising. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms a set of features in a dataset into a smaller number of features called principal components while at the same time trying to retain as much information in the original dataset as possible. Since we have 3 different variables, we have a three-dimensional data set. PCA can take 4 or more variables and make a two-dimensional PCA plot. PCA can also tell us which variable is the most valuable for clustering the data. It also can tell us how accurate the two-dimensional graph is.</p>
            <p>Principal Component Analysis calculates the average of each variable and using this average, finds the center of the data. It then shifts the data so that the center of the data is at the origin. From here, we input principal components. The principal components are vectors, but they are not chosen at random. The first principal component (PC1) is computed so that it explains the greatest amount of variance in the original features. Thus, it minimizes the distance between each data point on the graph (Sum of Squared) so PC1 is a linear combination of variables. </p>
            <p>In order to maximize variance, the first weight vector $w_{(1)}$ thus has to satisfy:</p>

            $$
                
            \begin{aligned}
            w_{(1)} &= \text{arg } \displaystyle{\max_{||w|| = 1}} \left( \sum_{i} {(t_1)}^2_{(i)} \right) \\
            &= \text{arg } \displaystyle{\max_{||w|| = 1}} \left( \sum_{i} {(x_{(i)} * w)}^2 \right)
            \end{aligned}
                
            $$

            <p>Since $w_{(1)}$ has been defined to be a unit vector, it equivalently also satisfies:</p>

            $$
            w_{(1)} = \text{arg max} \left( \frac{w^TX^TXw}{w^Tw} \right)
            $$

            <p>The quantity to be maximised can be recognised as a Rayleigh quotient. A standard result for a positive semidefinite matrix such as $X^TX$ is that the quotient&#39;s maximum possible value is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix, which occurs when $w$ is the corresponding eigenvector.</p>
            <p>In our analysis, we require more than one component. The $k^{th}$ component can be found by subtracting the first $k âˆ’ 1$ principal components from $X$ and then finding the weight vector which extracts the maximum variance from this new data matrix:</p>

            $$
            \hat X_k = X - \sum_{s=1}^{k-1}{Xw_{(s)}w_{(s)}^T}
            $$

            $$
                \begin{aligned}
                w_{(k)} &= \text{arg } \displaystyle{\max_{||w|| = 1}} \left( ||\hat X_{k}w||^2 \right) \\
                &= \text{arg max} \left( \frac{w^T\hat X_k^T\hat X_kw}{w^Tw} \right)
            \end{aligned}
            $$

            <p>The sum of squared distances for the best fit line is the eigenvalue for PC1. The second component (PC2) is orthogonal to the first, and it explains the greatest amount of variance left after the first principal component. Then we find PC3 which is perpendicular to PC1 and PC2 that goes through the origin. The number of PCs is either the number of variables or the number of samples, whichever is smaller.</p>

            <h5 id="elbow-curve"><b>Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means</b></h5>

            <p>
                K-means cluster identifies initial clusters and calculates the variances between each cluster or the Euclidean distance. It clusters all the remaining points, calculates the mean of each cluster, and then reclusters based on the new means. It repeats until the clusters no longer change. It restarts the cluster until it finds the best overall cluster. It does as much reclustering as we tell it to do. It then comes back and returns to the optimal one.
                First, we need to determine the best K value. An easy method for determining the best number for K is the elbow curve. To create an elbow curve, we'll plot the clusters on the x-axis and the values of a selected objective function on the y-axis. The intra-cluster distance is one of the most common objective functions to use when creating an elbow curve. The intra-cluster distance objective function is measuring the amount of variation in the dataset. For our elbow curve, we will plot the number of clusters (also known as the values of K) on the x-axis and the total intra-cluster distance values on the y-axis.
            </p>

            <p>
                Using the "elbow" or "knee of a curve" as a cutoff point is a common heuristic in mathematical optimization to choose a point where diminishing returns are no longer worth the additional cost. In clustering, this means one should choose a number of clusters so that adding another cluster doesn't give a much better modeling of the data. The intuition is that increasing the number of clusters will naturally improve the fit (explain more of the variation), since there are more parameters (more clusters) to use, but that at some point this is over-fitting, and the elbow reflects this. We can see that the total intra-cluster distance is large for k = 1 and decreases as we increase k, until k = 4, after which it tapers off and gets only marginally smaller. The slope becomes constant after k = 4. This indicates that k = 4 is a good choice. Therefore, will now cluster the states into four clusters using K-means.

            <h5 id="tradable-cryptocurrencies"><b>Tradable Cryptocurrencies By Predictions</b></h5>

            <p>
                First, we used the PCA data to predict the clusters. Then we added a new column, <code>Class</code> to hold our predictions. In other words, we determined that 
                there were 532 tradable cryptocurrencies and each are now separated by class.

            <p>
                Applying the K-means to the Principal Component Analysis projection data produces an additional categorical constraint to validate the clustering algorithm. 
                In other words, we can use dimensionality reduction as a feature extractor and reveal the different clusters. 
                Based on the 2D PCA plot with the clustering, we cannot tell if it is consistent with the clustering of 4 sections. Since we reduced the dimensions to 
                4 dimensions, we need to create higher dimensional plots. Therefore, we generated a 3D PCA plot to visualize the data.
