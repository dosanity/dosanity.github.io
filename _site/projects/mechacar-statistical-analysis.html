            <p>The purpose of this project is to analyze data for a prototype car. We are tasked to review the production data for insights in vehicle performance.

            <p>The <code>MechaCar_mpg.csv</code> dataset contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars.

Since both values are smaller than the significance level of 0.05, therefore both variables are statistically significant resulting in rejecting the null hypothesis. In other words, the slope of the linear model is not zero and these coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. Additionally, the R-Squared value of this multiple linear regression model is 0.71. The coefficient of determination represents how well the regression model approximates real-world data points. In our case, we have a strong likelihood that the model can be used to approximate the <code>mpg</code> values in the dataset.</p>

            <p>Based on our results for the t-test that compares manufacturing lot 2 against the mean PSI of the population, we can interpret that there is no statistical difference between the observed sample mean and its presumed population mean since the p-value is 0.6. It is not statistically significant as the p-value is greater than our significance level of 0.05.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>To further our analysis, we will design a statistical study to compare the vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h4 id="test-metrics"><b>Test Metrics</b></h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Fuel Efficiency: Measured by calculating the distance traveled by a vehicle and the amount of fuel consumed.</li>
                <li>Vehicle Price: The price of vehicle sold in the market.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h4 id="hypothesis"><b>Hypothesis</b></h4>

            <ul>
                <li>$H_0$ - There is no statistical difference between the observed mean of fuel efficiency and price with the observed mean of its competitors.</li>
                <li>$H_a$ - There is a statistical difference between the observed mean of fuel efficiency and price with the observed mean of its competitors.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h4 id="statistical-test"><b>Statistical Test</b></h4>

            <p>Since we are determining whether the means of two-samples (MechaCar vs Competitors) are statistically different, we will be utilizing the two-sample t-test to perform this analysis. The two dependent variables in the two analyses would be fuel efficiency and vehicle price.</p>
            
            $$
                t = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}
            $$

            <ul>
                <li>$\bar{x}$ - Sample mean</li>
                <li>$\mu$ - Population mean</li>
                <li>$s$ - Sample standard deviation</li>
                <li>$n$ - Number of observations</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h4 id="data-source"><b>Data Source</b></h4>
            
            <p>Since data would be difficult to obtain before the release of competitor cars, we can collect or scrape the data from outside sources on previous car models in the same class as the MechaCar. The data could potentially be found through competitor webpages since the information is public after the car&#39;s release. We would need the fuel efficiency and vehicle price data from the competitors. </p>
