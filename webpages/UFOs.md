# UFOs

## Project Overview

We are tasked to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by using JavaScript to establish data visualization through an encoded website. JavaScript is a front-end programming language designed to enhance websites to create dynamic web pages. It enables websites to be more visually appealing and interactive. By using this coding language with HTML and CSS, we organized data stored in a JavaScript array to created an interactive web page to allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Resources
+ Software: VS Code 1.71.0
+ Data Source: data.js
+ Programming Languages: JavaScript, CSS, HTML

## Website Results

#### The deployed webpage is accessible [here](https://dosanity.github.io/UFOs/).

The webpage created is interactive and user-friendly. It displays all the UFO sightings and allows the user to filter the data with multiple criteria such as date of the sighting, the location of the sighting, and the shape of the unidentified object.

By inputting the filters, it displays the results dynamically. For example, we filtered the state and shape variable in the following image.

## Summary

By creating this web page using JavaScript, it increases the efficiency to do in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. The website is interactive and users can filter the data easily to update real-time. Although it can organize data quickly into a table, there are potential drawbacks of the site. Some drawbacks include:

+ The filter search on the web page is case sensitive. For example, users inputting "Benton" instead of "benton" would lead to an invalid result. 

+ It is difficult to know the selection pool to filter the data. For example, a user would need to look through the data beforehand to know what types of variables can be filtered.

With these drawbacks, it creates ideas and recommendations for further development of the website. Some recommendations include:

+ One can implement JavaScript code to include case sensitivity to make the website more efficient.

+ Adding a dropdown menu to show a filter selection so that it makes the user interface more user-friendly and increases efficiency of filtering the data.
