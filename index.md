[Python Code 1](https://github.com/dosanity/SLC-Zillow-analysis/blob/main/ZillowUT_Data.ipynb){: .btn}
[Python Code 2](https://github.com/dosanity/SLC-Zillow-analysis/blob/main/ZillowUT_Analysis.ipynb){: .btn}

We will be analyzing real estate data from different cities in the Salt Lake County listed as of November, 2022. In this project, we will be scraping Zillow, an American tech real-estate marketplace company. After gathering the data, we will create different visualizations with geospatial analysis and charts to uncover preliminary trends between different variables. We will also be using linear regressions and different unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as Principle Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering to gain meaningful insights in the data we collected.

## [Unemployment on Inflation Analysis](/webpages/unemployment-inflation-analysis.md){: .und}

[Python Code](https://github.com/dosanity/unemployment-inflation-analysis/blob/main/Inflation.ipynb){: .btn}
[Research Paper](/assets/pdf/Inflation-and-Monetary-Policy.pdf){: .btn}

Our current economic climate is unique with the rise of the coronavirus. In the economy, we are seeing unique factors such as a high inflation rate paired with a low uneomployment rate. Historically, stagflation or recession-inflation occurs which is a situation where the inflation rate is high and unemployment remains high as well. We are particularly interested to see how these changes in the unemployment rate are potentially impacting the increase in inflation rate.

## [Credit Risk Analysis](/webpages/Credit_Risk_Analysis.md){: .und}

[Python Code 1](https://github.com/dosanity/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/credit_risk_resampling.ipynb){: .btn} 
[Python Code 2](https://github.com/dosanity/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/credit_risk_ensemble.ipynb){: .btn} 

Credit risk is the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations. To determine credit risk, it requires the creditors to evaluate customers based on their credit score. As a result of this, there are classification imbalances with credit risk because good loans outnumber riskier loans. We are tasked to build a classification model using machine learning statistical algorithms to make predictions on the credit risk of a client. In our analysis, we will be using the credit card credit dataset from [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com/), a peer-to-peer lending services company.

## [Salt Lake City Real Estate](/webpages/slc-real-estate-analysis.md){: .und}

[Python Code](https://github.com/dosanity/SLC-real-estate-analysis/blob/main/SLC-real-estate.ipynb){: .btn}

We analyzed the SLC real estate data. The dataset contains multiple listing service (MLS) real estate transactions for houses sold in 2015-16 in zip code 84103 (SLC avenues neighborhood). We were primarily interested in regressing the SoldPrice on the house attributes (property size, house size, number of bedrooms, etc...).


## [MechaCar Statistical Analysis](/webpages/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis.md){: .und}

[R Code](https://github.com/dosanity/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/MechaCarChallenge.R){: .btn}

The purpose of this project is to analyze data for a new prototype car, the MechaCar. There are production issues that are blocking the manufacturing team's progress and we are tasked to review the production data for insights. Using the programming language R, we will perform multiple linear regressions, summary statistics, and t-tests to produce statistical interpretations.

## [Webscrape GitHub Repositories](/webpages/webscraping-github-analysis.md){: .und}

[Python Code](https://github.com/dosanity/webscraping-github-analysis/blob/main/webscraping-github-analysis.py){: .btn}

A Git repository tracks and saves the history of all changes made to the files in a Git project. It saves this data in a directory called . git, also known as the repository folder. Git uses a version control system to track all changes made to the project and save them in the repository. In this project, we will be scraping GitHub repositories and organize the information in a Pandas dataframe. After that, we will use linear regressions to gain meaningful insights on the data we collected. Our goal is to identify properties that make a repository popular which will give insights on future uses of repositories.

## [Pewlett Hackard Analysis](/webpages/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.md){: .und}

[SQL Code](https://github.com/dosanity/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Queries/Employee_Database_challenge.sql){: .btn}

Pewlett-Packard (PH) is a large firm that currently employs 300,024 individuals. Many employees are approaching retirement age, which will result in a significant number of job openings in the organization. We will be conducting a database analysis for Pewlett Hackard with detailed information on the number of future retirees from all departments currently working at the company to be able to prepare a plan to hire new staff and also to prepare a mentorship initiative.

## [Election Analysis](/webpages/election-analysis.md){: .und}

[Python Code](https://github.com/dosanity/election-analysis/blob/main/PyPoll_Challenge.py){: .btn}

We are tasked by a Colorado Board of Elections employee to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. We are reporting the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. In this analysis, we will research three different voting methods: Mail-in ballots, punch cards, and Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) counting machines. The votes cast by these three methods will determine the final election results. We are generating a vote count report to certify the U.S. congressional race.

## [US Crime Analysis](/webpages/us-crime-analysis.md){: .und}

[Python Code](https://github.com/dosanity/us-crime-analysis/blob/main/US-crime-analysis.ipynb){: .btn}

There are many crimes that happen in the United States. Some believe that bigger cities and more populated states have more crime rates. In this project, we will be analyzing a dataset describing 1973 violent crime rates by US State. The crimes considered are assault, murder, and rape. Also included is the percent of the population living in urban areas. Our goal is to use unsupervised machine learning methods such as Cluster Heat Maps, Principle Component Analysis, K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN to understand how violent crimes differ between states.

## [Online News Popularity](/webpages/online-news-analysis.md){: .und} 

[Python Code](https://github.com/dosanity/online-news-analysis/blob/main/online-news-popularity.ipynb){: .btn}

We compared different classification tools such as K-NN, SVM, and Decision Trees to predict the popularity of online news based on attributes such as the length of the article, the number of images, the day of the week that the article was published, and some variables related to the content of the article.

## [MNIST Handwritten Digits](/webpages/MNIST-digits-analysis.md){: .und}

[Python Code](https://github.com/dosanity/MNIST-digits-analysis/blob/main/MNIST-digits.ipynb){: .btn}

The MNIST handwritten digit dataset consists of images of handwritten digits, together with labels indicating which digit is in each image. We can see that images are just matrices with scalar values so we can apply the different classification algorithms on them. Because both the features and the labels are present in this dataset (and labels for large datasets are generally difficult/expensive to obtain), this dataset is frequently used as a benchmark to compare various classification methods. For example, this webpage gives a comparison of a variety of different classification methods on MNIST. Our goal is to use scikit-learn machine learning to compare classification methods on the MNIST dataset.

## [School District Analysis](/webpages/school_district_analysis.md){: .und}

[Python Code](https://github.com/dosanity/school_district_analysis/blob/main/PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb){: .btn}

We are tasked to analyze data on student funding and student standardized test scores. We will be aggregating the data to showcase trends and school performance. In this analysis, we will assist the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities. Additionally, we are aware of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) which protects the privacy of student education records. This law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. Therefore, we will be data mining using general education data to predict trends and performances.

## [PyBer Analysis](/webpages/PyBer_Analysis.md){: .und}

[Python Code](https://github.com/dosanity/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer.ipynb){: .btn}

Pyber is a python based ride sharing app. We are tasked to perform performing an exploratory analysis and creating visualizations using rideshare data to help improve access to rideshare services and determine affordability for underserved areas. In this analysis we will showcase the relationship between the type of city (Urban, Suburban, and Rural), and the number of drivers and riders. Additionally, we will calculate the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city.

## [Movie Analysis](/webpages/movie-analysis.md){: .und}

[Python Code](https://github.com/dosanity/movie-analysis/blob/main/movie-analysis.py){: .btn}

There are many different movies throughout the years that were successful, but also many that failed. There are also old movies that people consider to be classics and are still watched today. In this project, we will be analyzing movies from the 1900 to 2005 and organize the information in a Pandas dataframe. After that, we will use statistical analysis and visualize different charts to determine if older movies are better than newer ones.

## [Hawaii Weather Analysis](/webpages/surfs_up.md){: .und}

[Python Code](https://github.com/dosanity/surfs_up/blob/main/climate_analysis.ipynb){: .btn}

We are tasked to analyze and examine weather trends for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii in order to deterimine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable on the island. We will be using Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of the meteorological data in a SQLite database. From there we will write queries to examine the temperature data for the months of June and December.

## [UFO Sightings](/webpages/UFOs.md){: .und}
