## [Salt Lake City Real Estate](/slc-real-estate-analysis.md){: .btn}

We analyzed the SLC real estate data. The dataset contains multiple listing service (MLS) real estate transactions for houses sold in 2015-16 in zip code 84103 (SLC avenues neighborhood). We were primarily interested in regressing the SoldPrice on the house attributes (property size, house size, number of bedrooms, etc...).

## [US Crime Analysis](/us-crime-analysis.md){: .btn}

There are many crimes that happen in the United States. Some believe that bigger cities and more populated states have more crime rates. In this project, we will be analyzing a dataset describing 1973 violent crime rates by US State. The crimes considered are assault, murder, and rape. Also included is the percent of the population living in urban areas. Our goal is to use unsupervised machine learning methods such as Cluster Heat Maps, Principle Component Analysis, K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN to understand how violent crimes differ between states.

## [Webscrape GitHub Repositories](/webscraping-github-analysis.md){: .btn}

There are many GitHub repostories and some are more popular than others. A Git repository tracks and saves the history of all changes made to the files in a Git project. It saves this data in a directory called . git , also known as the repository folder. Git uses a version control system to track all changes made to the project and save them in the repository. In this project, we will be scraping GitHub repositories and organize the information in a Pandas dataframe. After that, we will use linear regressions to gain meaningful insights on the data we collected. Our goal is to identify properties that make a repository popular which will give insights on future uses of repositories.
